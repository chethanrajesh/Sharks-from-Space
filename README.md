# Sharks From Space 🦈🌊

**Short description:** A reproducible pipeline and interactive dashboard for exploring shark habitat preferences using satellite data (chlorophyll, SST) and bathymetry. Built with Python, Xarray, scikit-learn and Streamlit.

## Quick start ✅
1. Create an environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Fetch required satellite data and bathymetry (examples):

```bash
python get_sst.py
python get_depth.py
python get_data.py
```

3. Run the exploratory notebook:

- Open `notebooks/exploration.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run cells in order.
- The notebook prepares training data, trains models (1–3 variables), creates prediction maps, and saves artifacts to `../models/` and `../reports/`.

4. Start the interactive app:

```bash
streamlit run shark_app.py
```

## Project structure 📁
- `notebooks/` — exploratory and modeling notebooks (main workflow is `exploration.ipynb`).
- `data/` — processed CSVs (e.g., `my_training_data.csv`, `shark_tracks.csv`).
- `downloads/` — raw downloaded NetCDFs (chlorophyll, sst, bathymetry).
- `models/` — saved numpy arrays, trained model(s), scalers, and supporting grids.
- `reports/` — generated figures, maps, and interactive HTML dashboard.
- `shark_app.py` — Streamlit application to visualize maps and shark data.
- `get_sst.py`, `get_depth.py`, `get_data.py` — data fetching scripts.
- `main.py` — project-level orchestration (data processing / pipeline runner).

---

## Notebooks & scripts 🧪
- `notebooks/exploration.ipynb` — end-to-end analysis:
  - Extracts satellite values at shark and background points
  - Trains logistic regression models (1-3 vars)
  - Builds prediction maps and a lightweight interactive dashboard
  - Saves models/scalers (`models/shark_ai_model.pkl`, `models/shark_scaler.pkl`) and final images (`reports/`)

- `shark_app.py` — Streamlit app that loads `models/*.npy` and `shark_data.csv` to produce an interactive mapping app.

---

## Outputs 📦
- `models/lat_grid.npy`, `models/lon_grid.npy`, `models/map_*.npy` — precomputed raster layers for fast app loading.
- `models/shark_ai_model.pkl`, `models/shark_scaler.pkl` — trained model and scaler.
- `reports/shark_dashboard.html`, `reports/shark_habitat_map.png` — visual outputs and dashboard.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips ⚠️
- If the notebooks cannot find satellite files, confirm `downloads/` exists and contains `.nc` files for `chlorophyll`, `sst`, and `bathymetry`.
- Large NetCDF bathymetry files may cause RAM issues. The notebook includes safe downsampling and resizing strategies (check the "Safe Mode" steps in `exploration.ipynb`).
- If models or scalers are not found, re-run the model training cells (Steps 12–14 in `exploration.ipynb`) and re-save them (there's a cell to re-save final model/scaler).
- Windows users: be mindful of path separators when running commands from PowerShell.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Amisha2121/Sharks.git
   cd Sharks
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies (create a `requirements.txt` and update this step once ready):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Run the helper script:
  ```
  python create_shark_notebook.py
  ```
- Open `shark_Foraging_LongTerm.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code to explore the analyses.
